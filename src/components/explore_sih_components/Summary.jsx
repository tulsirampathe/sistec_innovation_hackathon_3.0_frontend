            In the vibrant arena of SISTec Innovation Hackathon (SIH 1.0), 135
            of us teamed up, faced 23 challenges in 9 cool areas, and had a
            blast coding for two whole days. The top 3 champs scored Rs. 25,000,
            Rs. 20,000, and Rs. 15,000! SIH 1.0 wasn't just a hackathon, it was
            a journey where challenges were like secret doors to great ideas. it
            was about creating awesome solutions and building a community.
            Remember, every challenge is a chance for a big idea. So, keep
            coding, keep dreaming, and get ready for the next big breakthrough â€“
            it might just be a click away!
